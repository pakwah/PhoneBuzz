#PhoneBuzz

##Phase 1 : completed

###How to build

In order for Twilio to be able to access the web server hosted on the local machine, I used ngrok. Download [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) and run the executable using the command `ngrok http [port]` with 'port' being the one the server listens to.

After ngrok is launched, it will generate a public URL in the "Forwarding" line, through which the web server can be reached by Twilio. Simply copy the https URL and configure the testing Twilio number's "Voice Request URL" to be the one generated by ngrok.

To launch the server in the shell, navigate to where `phonebuzz.js` is located and run the command `AUTH_TOKEN='YOUR TOKEN' PORT='YOUR PORT' node phonebuzz.js` after replacing `AUTH_TOKEN` and `PORT` with the desired values as parameters. Then you can dial the number associated with the provided authentication token and follow the directions to have a round of phonebuzz game.
